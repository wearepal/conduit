# conduit :electron:

Al lightweight framework for channeling the power of PyTorch Lightning.

## Installation
Conduit requires Python 3.8 or higher. To install the latest version from PyPI:

```
pip install -U 'torch-conduit[all]'
```

Unfortunately, you have to install the dependency `pytorch-lightning` manually:
```
pip install pytorch-lightning
```
This is because of dependency problems with pytorch.
